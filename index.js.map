will compress and become shorter when loaded and can be used for a variety of\r\n                    applications.\r\n                <p>\r\n                    DVT Compression springs are helical, or coiled, springs that generate resistance to axially applied\r\n                    compressive force and store energy for application. Although the compression come in a standard\r\n                    shape, compression springs can be coiled by compression spring manufacturers into a number of\r\n                    different shapes.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    There are cone-shaped compression springs, concave, or barrel-shaped compression springs, and convex\r\n                    or hourglass-shaped compression springs. There are small compression springs and larger compressions\r\n                    springs. Other, related shapes, as well as heavy-duty compression springs, are also possible\r\n                    depending upon the buyer’s needs.\r\n                </p>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Compression springs can also be left-hand coiled or right-hand coiled, indicated by the way the coil\r\n                    is bent. Which way the spring is coiled typically is not an issue, but nested springs should be\r\n                    coiled in opposite directions.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The basic information needed by DVT Spring is material, wire size, free length, number of coils,\r\n                    travel, diameter, end types, finish, works over, works in, and maximum solid height. It is crucial\r\n                    to carefully consider the space allotted to ensure that the spring will function properly and avoid\r\n                    costly design changes.

For example, in a car's\r\n            suspension system, which interacts with the car's shock absorbers, the torsion angle of the spring\r\n            deforms the material and returns it to its original state. Thereby preventing the car from shaking\r\n            too much,which plays a good role in protecting the safety system of the car. However, the spring will\r\n            fail during the entire protection process, which is called fatigue fracture, so technicians or consumers\r\n            should pay attention to fatigue fracture.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </el-col>\r\n        <el-col :span=\"2\">\r\n        </el-col>\r\n      </el-row>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"scenario\" style=\"background:#F2F6FC;height: 880px;\">\r\n      <el-row justify=\"start\" type=\"flex\">\r\n        <el-col :span=\"1\">\r\n        </el-col>\r\n        <el-col :span=\"22\">\r\n          <h1 style=\"font-size: 50px;text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-color: #E6A23C;\">\r\n            Application Scenario</h1>\r\n          <el-row :gutter=\"20\">\r\n            <el-card :body-style=\"{ padding: '0px' }\" style=\"min-width:460px;height:320px\">\r\n              <el-col :span=\"24\">\r\n                <el-image style=\"width: 100%; height: 320px\" :src=\"scenario1\">\r\n                </el-image>\r\n                <div class=\"imghover1\">\r\n                  <h3 style=\"color:#FFFFFF;text-align: center;margin-top: 10%;\">HEADPHONE SPRING</h3>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </el-col>\r\n            </el-card>\r\n            <el-card :body-style=\"{ padding: '0px' }\" style=\"min-width:460px;height:320px\">\r\n              <el-col :span=\"24\">\r\n                <el-image style=\"width: 100%; height: 320px\" :src=\"scenario2\">\r\n                </el-image>\r\n                <div class=\"imghover2\">\r\n                  <h3 style=\"color:#FFFFFF;text-align: center;margin-top: 10%;\">SHOCK ABSORB SPRING</h3>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </el-col>\r\n            </el-card>\r\n            <el-card :body-style=\"{ padding: '0px' }\" style=\"min-width:460px;height:320px\">\r\n              <el-col :span=\"24\">\r\n                <el-image style=\"width: 100%; height: 320px\" :src=\"scenario3\">\r\n                </el-image>\r\n                <div class=\"imghover3\">\r\n                  <h3 style=\"color:#FFFFFF;text-align: center;margin-top: 10%;\">AUTOMOTIVE SUSPENSION SPRING</h3>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </el-col>\r\n            </el-card>\r\n            <el-card :body-style=\"{ padding: '0px' }\" style=\"min-width:935px;height:320px\">\r\n              <el-col :span=\"24\">\r\n                <el-image style=\"width: 100%; height: 320px\" :src=\"scenario4\">\r\n                </el-image>\r\n                <div class=\"imghover4\">\r\n                  <h3 style=\"color:#FFFFFF;text-align: center;margin-top: 5%;\">GARAGE DOOR SPRING</h3>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </el-col>\r\n            </el-card>\r\n            <el-card :body-style=\"{ padding: '0px' }\" style=\"min-width:460px;height:320px\">\r\n              <el-col :span=\"24\">\r\n                <el-image style=\"width: 100%; height: 320px\" :src=\"scenario5\">\r\n                </el-image>\r\n                <div class=\"imghover5\">\r\n                  <h3 style=\"color:#FFFFFF;text-align: center;margin-top: 10%;\">VALVE SPRING</h3>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </el-col>\r\n            </el-card>\r\n            <el-col :span=\"1\">\r\n            </el-col>\r\n          </el-row>\r\n        </el-col>\r\n        <el-col :span=\"1\">\r\n        </el-col>\r\n      </el-row>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"news\" style=\"height:780px;\">\r\n      <el-row justify=\"start\" type=\"flex\">\r\n        <el-col :span=\"1\">\r\n        </el-col>\r\n        <el-col :span=\"22\">\r\n          <h1 style=\"font-size: 50px;text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-color: #E6A23C;\">\r\n            Latest News</h1>\r\n          <el-row :gutter=\"24\" justify=\"center\" type=\"flex\">\r\n            <el-card :body-style=\"{ padding: '0px' }\">\r\n              <el-col :span=\"24\">\r\n                <router-link to=\"/News/torsion-spring\">\r\n                  <el-image :src=\"news1\" fit=\"cover\"></el-image>\r\n                </router-link>\r\n                <el-divider></el-divider>\r\n                <p>\r\n                <h3 class=\"hh5\" style=\"margin-left:2%\">\r\n                  Torsion Spring.\r\n                </h3>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p style=\"margin-left:2%\">A torsion spring is a spring that works by torsion or twisting.

A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal that is subjected to\r\n                    twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Heavy duty torsion springs (single or double) are another DVT Spring Manufacturing specialty, and\r\n                    are utilized in various technical instruments as well as many types of machinery and equipment.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Torsion springs mainly play a balancing role in industrial production. For example, in a car’s\r\n                    suspension system, which interacts with the car’s shock absorbers, the torsion angle of the spring\r\n                    deforms the material and returns it to its original state. Thereby preventing the car from shaking\r\n                    too much, which plays a good role in protecting the safety system of the car. However, the spring\r\n                    will break and fail during the entire protection process, which is called fatigue fracture, so\r\n                    technicians or consumers should pay attention to fatigue fracture. As a technician, we should do our\r\n                    best to avoid sharp corners, notches, and sudden changes in section in the structural design of\r\n                    parts, thereby reducing fatigue cracks caused by stress concentrations. Therefore, Spring\r\n                    manufacturers should improve the machining quality of the surface of the torsion springs to reduce\r\n                    the source of fatigue. In addition, surface strengthening treatment can also be used for different\r\n                    torsion spring.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    <el-image

typically use is known as a helical torsion spring.\r\n                    This is a metal wire twisted into a helix, or coil shape, using sideways forces to twist the wire\r\n                    around its axis, as opposed to using shear stress, as in the torsion bar.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    DVT Spring has over seventeen years of experience manufacturing the highest-quality torsion springs.\r\n                    If you need torsion springs, or are looking for torsion spring replacements, there’s only one\r\n                    company
